		'Out in the blustering darkness, on the deck\
		A gleam of stars looks down. Long blurs of black,\
		The lean Destroyers, level with our track,\
		Plunging and stealing, watch the perilous way\
		Through backward racing seas and caverns of chill spray.\
	    One sentry by the davits, in the gloom\
	    Stands mute: the boat heaves onward through the night.\
	    Shrouded is every chink of cabined light:\
	    And sluiced by floundering waves that hiss and boomAnd crash like guns,\
	    the troop-ship shudders ... doom.',
		'The storeroom was a damp chamber in what had been the old farmhouse.\
		There was no carpet on the uneven floor, \
		and nothing to sit down on but a school form. \
		It was black as pitch, for the windows were heavily shuttered. \
		I made out by groping that \
		the walls were lined with boxes and barrels and sacks of \
		some heavy stuff. \
		The whole place smelt of mould and disuse. \
		My gaolers turned the key in the door, \
		and I could hear them shifting their feet\
		as they stood on guard outside.'
